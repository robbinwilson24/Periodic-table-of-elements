## Full Description: <a name="program-description"/>
This project is a periodic table of elements that I have coded with HTML and CSS. 
I have created it to demonstrate my ability to use HTML as well as to showcase my ability to use various CSS components to manipulate the HTML and to make something that is visually appealing.

As this is a simple webpage, it only has basic features. Such as the following:

- Hover-over effects on each element where the element changes size.
- Use of background gradients. 
- A media query to change the layout of the webpage to display a simple image of the periodic tableonce the screen size is smaller than 710px.
